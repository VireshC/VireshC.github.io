		<p><b><p class="center">Publisher: Activision, Infinity Ward</b></p>
		<p class="green"><p class="center"><b>Score: 9/10</b></p>
		<p>This entry in the Call of Duty franchise was a refreshing experience. From the revamped movement system to the customization and maps in multiplayer,
		to the enthralling storyline and high replay value co-op, this game has proven to me to be the most fun that I have ever had in a Call of Duty game. The addition of Battle Royale in the form of Warzone has provided me with many days of enjoyment,
		and has become the most popular game in the genre.</p>
		<p><b>Pros: Multiplayer weapon balance, map design, Warzone BR, campaign, customization, + more<b/></p>
		<p> Cons: No map voting, SBMM, Camping-oriented community</p>

		<h2 class="dotted"><p class="center">Grand Theft Auto V</h2>
		<img src="images/gtav.jpg" alt="Grand Theft Auto 5" width="250" height="300"/>
		<p><span><p class="center">Publisher: Rockstar Games</span></p>
		<p class="green"><p class="center"><b>Score: 9/10</b></p>
		<p><span>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V represented a major shift in the gaming world. I still remember the waves that this game caused
		when it was released back in 2013. GTA V is widely regarded as having one of the most expansive and fun multiplayers in an open-world game in the form of GTA Online.
		The story that follows three characters with extremely unique character deisgn but that still fit in the cliches and demographics of a modern-day Los Angeles 
		is one of the greatest story modes that I have ever played in a game. It is the closet to a feature film that I have ever seen a game's storyline be. I have spend hundreds of hours modding my experience to vast extents as well.</span></p>
		<p><b>Pros: Expansive Online mode, Long and through story, graphical longevity, modding capability + more</p></b>
		<p>Cons: Prioritization of microtransactions, bugs + glitches</p></b>

		<h2 class="dotted"><p class="center">Minecraft</h2>
		<img src="images/mc.png" alt="Minecraft" width="200" height="300"/>
		<p><span><p class="center">Publisher: Mojang</span></p>
		<p class="dotted"><p class="center"><b>Score: 10/10</b></p>
		<p><span>Mojang's open-world block-based building game captured my youth in 2013. It has since become the most downloaded game in history, surpassing Tetris a few years
		back. Most people have heard of, if not played this game, so there is not much to say about it. It has offered millions of people countless opportunities, from content creation
		to , and even to education.</p></b>
		<p><b>Pros: Multiplayer, creative, survival, and adventure modes. Map sharing, skin sharing, texture and shader packs, server hosting, coding, modding capabilities + more</p></b>
		<p><b>Cons: None?! ;-)</p></b>

		<h2 class="dotted"><p class="center">Fortnite</h2>
		<img src="images/fort.jpg" alt="Fortnite" width="200" height="300"/>
		<p><b><p class="center">Publisher: Epic Games</b></p>
		<p class="yellow"><p class="center"><b>Score: 7/10</b></p>
		<p><span> Epic Game's Fortnite was rated by me based on nostalia value, as that is what it has become; a game for those seeking to return to the "good old days."
		Recent additions and changes to the game have aliennated whatever remaining fanbase the game has aquired during its initial succes from 2017-2018. Whle remaining an above average game mechanically, especially being free to play, the try-hard nature of competition lowered this game's rating to me.</span></p>
		<p><b>Pros: Still fun multiplayer, good user-creation features</p></b>
		<p><b>Cons: No casual playerbase, microtransactions, questionable additions to the game, + more. </p></b>
